# arduino/

This directory contains the arduino control code for the light tunnel ([`lt_mk_1`](lt_mk_1/)) and wind tunnel ([`wt_mk_1`](wt_mk_1/)) described in the paper. Each directory contains a Makefile to compile the code and upload it to the arduino board using [arduino-cli](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/installation/).
